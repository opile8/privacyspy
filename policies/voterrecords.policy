10. Google
Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for Users and can be found here: https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en

We use Google AdSense Advertising on Our website. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on Our Site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to Our Users based on previous visits to Our Site and other Sites on the internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network Privacy Policy.

The Site utilizes Remarketing with Google AdSense, Google display network impression reporting, demographics and interests reporting, and DoubleClick platform integration. The Site, along with third-party vendors such as Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding User interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to Our Site.

If You wish to opt out, Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to You using the Google Ad settings page. Alternatively, You can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising initiative opt out page or permanently using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.

11. Your California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits Users of the Site that are California residents to request certain information about Our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make this request, please send an email on the Contact Us page.

Further, if You are a California resident and would like to opt out from the disclosure of Your personal information to any third-party for marketing purposes, please send an email on the Contact Us page. Please be advised that if You opt out from permitting Your personal information to be shared, You may still receive selected offers directly from the Website in accordance with California law.

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. You can review further here: https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals, We are unable to guarantee that Our security is one hundred percent (100%) breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite Our reasonable security measures.
